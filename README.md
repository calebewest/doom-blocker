# Doom Blocker

A browser extension that blocks infinite scroll feeds on major websites to help you stay focused and reduce doomscrolling.

## 🎯 What It Does

Doom Blocker removes distracting infinite scroll feeds from websites, helping you maintain better focus and productivity. Currently supports:

- **YouTube**: Hides the recommendation sidebars, related videos panels, YouTube Shorts, and expands the main video player to full width
- **LinkedIn**: Hides the main feed to prevent endless scrolling through job postings and sponsored content

The extension works silently in the background and includes a popup panel showing when it's active with a toggle button to enable/disable the blocking.

## 🚀 Future Steps

The roadmap includes expanding Feed Hider to block doomscroll feeds on additional major platforms:

### Planned Additions
- **TikTok**: Hide the infinite For You feed
- **Reddit**: Block the home feed and popular feeds
- **Twitter/X**: Hide the algorithmic timeline
- **Instagram**: Block the feed and Reels
- **Facebook**: Hide the news feed
- **Twitch**: Block the recommended streams feed

### Development Goals
- Add granular controls to selectively hide different types of content (i.e. some users may want to block the news instead of reels)
- Implement whitelist/blacklist functionality for specific channels or creators
- Add time-based scheduling (e.g., disable blocking during work hours)
- Create a dashboard showing time saved from not doomscrolling
- Support for additional social media platforms based on user feedback

### Adding a New Site

To add blocking for a new website:

1. Create a new content script in `content/` (e.g., `tiktok.js`)
2. Update `manifest.json` to include the new site:
   ```json
   {
     "matches": ["*://*.tiktok.com/*"],
     "js": ["content/tiktok.js"],
     "run_at": "document_idle"
   }
   ```
3. Implement the blocking logic using DOM selectors and `MutationObserver` to handle dynamic content
